# Logistic-Data-Processor
A tool design for my client, which reduce 90% of the time to fill out all the required data manually. 


# üì¶ Delivery Cost Estimator

A small Python project that calculates estimated shipping weight and cost based on product quantity and box type.
It‚Äôs designed to automate part of a real-world logistics workflow ‚Äî showing how even simple Python scripts can make operations more efficient.

## üß† What It Does

* Determines which **box type** (A, B, or D) to use based on quantity
* Calculates **total package weight** including cooling cubes and buffer materials
* Estimates **total product value** in USD
* Prints summarized results for different quantities

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** None (pure Python)

## üåç Why I Built This

I wanted to solve a real-world business problem ‚Äî quickly estimating shipment weight and cost for medical skincare exports.
Even without a tech background, this project helped me apply data logic to streamline repetitive work.
